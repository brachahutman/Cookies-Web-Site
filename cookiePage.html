			<h3>Basic Techniques</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Always leave enough time for cookie baking. Check the amount of time the recipe will take you. You don't want underdone 
				cookies!</li>
				<li>Cookies are often formed in a ball shape. Roll a small chunk of dough gently in your hands, until it resembles an even 
				ball. For medium-sized cookies, the ball should be about an inch in width. For many cookie types, you can place your ball 
				gently on a cookie sheet, and it will spread into a familiar flat cookie while it's baking. Some recipes require that you 
				flatten the ball into a cookie shape.</li>
				<li>The best way to bake cookies is with a cookie sheet. You can purchase one of these long, flat metal pans for a minimal 
				fee, or use a disposable option.</li>
				<li>Always spray your cookie sheet with cooking spray or coat with butter before placing cookies. This will prevent cookies 
				from sticking to the pan</li>
				<li>You can usually tell when a cookie is done when it turns golden at the edges. Do not leave your cookies in the oven for 
				too long or they will burn!</li>
